    longDescription: |
      This software, written in R, and deployed as a Shiny application, is a fast and reliable solution to show, filter and download 60 years of climatic informations of Emilia
      Romagna Region in the Po Valley. The description of the dataset along with the original datasets is available (in Italian only) at: https://dati.arpae.it/dataset/erg5-eraclito
      The original data sets need to be merged and compressed to fst file format in order to be used. A complete and compressed fst file format is available here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1isHbS6xNoo2unsMenDcPll1VA82Zacd2/view?usp=sharing
